Journal Entry 5
Aggregate Window Functions 
1. MAX Window Function
   - Shows the highest medals won by brazil in a given Olympic
     ```sql
      SELECT
       Year, Medals, MAX(Medals)
           OVER (ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Max_medals
     FROM Brazil_Medals; 
     ```
2. SUM Window Function
    - Shows the cummulative sum of medals won by brazil in a given Olymmpic  
     ```sql
      SELECT Year, Medals, SUM(Medals)
           OVER (ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Medals_RT
     FROM Brazil_Medals 
     ```
3. Can partition the aggregate window functions
    - Paritioning the cummalative medals won by each country throughout the Olympics
    - Shows how many cummulative medals each country won 
      ```sql
      WITH Medals AS (...) #Setting up the CTE
      SELECT Year, Country, Medals,
        SUM(Medals) OVER (PARTITION BY Country ...)
      FROM Medals 
      ```
4. Frames
    - You need to use Frames to create a window of just the section that you want to do the analysis on
    - By default, it would return the row's value within the column for the whole dataset rather than just the window
    - For frames, by default, it starts at the beginning of the table or parition and ends at the current row
    - Defining a frame
        - ROWS BETWEEN [START] AND [FINISH]
            - n PRECEDING : n rows before the current row
            - CURRENT ROW : the current row
            - n FOLLOWING : n rows after the current row
5. Moving averages and totals
    - Moving average : Average of the last n periods
        - Used to indicate momentum / trends
        - Useful in eliminating seasonality
    - Moving total: Sum of the last n periods
        - Used to indicate performance
    - ROWS vs RANGE
        - RANGE treates duplicates in OVER's ORDER BY subclause as a single entity
