Journal Entry 9

- Reformatting string and character data
  - Reformatting string and character data
  - Parsing string and character data
  - Determine string length and character position
  - Truncating and padding string data
- String concatenation operator
  - Combining strings together
  ```sql
  SELECT
    first_name, last_name,
    first_name || ' ' \\ last_name AS full_name
  FROM customer 
  ```
  - PostgreSQL string concatenation function
  ```sql
  SELECT
    CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name) AS full_name
  FROM customer 
  ```
    - arguments can be a column within a table or just a literal value and will return the concatenated value
  - String concatenation with non-string inputs
  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id || ": " || first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
  FROM customer;
  ```
  - Changing the case of string
    - Making every case capitalized : UPPER()
      - Used to normalize string datasets
    - Making every case lowered : LOWER()
      - Also used to normalize string datasets
    - Converting to title capitalization : INITCAP() 
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(email)
  FROM customer; 
  ```
  - Replacing characters in a string
    - Takes in 3 arguements : REPLACE(source string, value to replace, value to replace with)
  ```sql
  SELECT
    REPLACE(description, 'A Astounding', 'An Astounding') AS description
  FROM film; 
  ```
  - Reversing order of string
    - Just reverses the entire string that is given
  ```sql
  SELECT
    title,
    REVERSE(title)
  FROM film; 
  ```
- Parsing string and character data
  - Determining the length of a string using CHAR_LENGTH() or LENGTH() 
    - Gets string as input and outputs number of characters in the string as an output
    - Can be used interchangably 
  ```sql
  SELECT
    title,
    CHAR_LENGTH(title)
  FROM film; 
  ```
  - Finding the position of a character in a string using POSITION() or STRPOS() 
    - Returns the index position of value in string
  ```sql
  SELECT
    email,
    POSITION('@' IN email)
  FROM customer;
  
  SELECT
    email,
    STRPOS(email, '@')
  FROM customer; 
  ```
  - Parsing string data
    - LEFT(string, value) : allows you to extract the first n characters of a string
    - RIGHT(string, value) : allows you to extract the last n characters of a string
    - SUBTRING(string, starting_integer, length_of_sub_string) : allows you to extract
      a specified length substring starting at certain position in string
  ```sql
  SELECT
    LEFT(email, 50),
    RIGHT(email, 50)
    SUBSTRING(email, 5, 15)
  FROM customer;   
  ```
  - Extracting substrings of character data
  ```sql
  SELECT
    SUBSTRING(email FROM 0 FOR POSITION('@' IN email))
  FROM customer 
  ```
    - Extracts all the strings before the @
    - Starting position replaced with FROM 0
    - Ending position replaced with FOR POSITION('@' IN email)
  ```sql
  SELECT
    SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email)+1 FOR LENGTH(email))
  FROM customer; 
  ```
    - Extracts all the strings after the @
    - Starting position replaced with FROM POSITION('@' IN email) + 1 to avoid included the @ sign
    - Ending position replaced with FOR LENGTH(email)
  - Removing whitespace from strings
