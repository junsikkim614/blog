Journal Entry 7

- Common data types in PostgreSQL
  - Text data types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT)
  - Numeric data types (INT and DECIMAL)
  - Date / time data types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL)
  - Arrays
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, data_type
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
  WHERE column_name in ('title','description','special_features')
    AND table_name = 'film';
  ```
- Date and time functions and operators
  - TIMESTAMP data type
    - yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss
  - DATE
    - yyyy-mm-dd
  - TIME
    - hh-mm-ss
  - INTERVAL
    - Useful when doing math on the date column
    ```sql
    SELECT rental_date + INTERVAL '3 days' as expected_return
    FROM rental;
    ```
      - adds 3 days from the rental date
- ARRAYs
  - Creating, inserting and assessing tables with two array columns 
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE grades (
    student_id int,
    email text[][],
    test_scores int[]
  );

  INSERT INTO grades VALUES (
    1, '{{"work","work1@gmail.com"},{"other","other1@gmail.com"}},{92,85,96,88}');

  SELECT
    email[1][1] AS type,
    email[1][2] AS address,
    test_scores[1],
  FROM grades; 
  ```
    - PostgreSQL array indexes start at 1 instead of 0 like other languages
  - Searching within Arrays
  ```sql
  SELECT
    email[1][1] as type,
    email[1][2] as address,
    test_scores[1]
  FROM grades
  WHERE email[1][1] = 'work'; 
  ```
  - ARRAY functions and operators
  ```sql
  SELECT
    email[1][1] as type,
    email[1][2] as address,
    test_scores[1]
  FROM grades
  WHERE 'other' = ANY (email);

  SELECT
    email[1][1] as type,
    email[1][2] as address,
    test_scores[1]
  FROM grades
  WHERE email @> ARRAY['other'];
  ```
  - Today I learned about the different data types within PostgreSQL as well as arrays. I learned the different types
of data types for date and time and how to manipulate them with simple math using the INTERVAL function. I learned 
how to create tables with arrays, how to input values, as well as to find values within those arrays.
