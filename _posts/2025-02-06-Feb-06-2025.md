Journal Entry 8

- Basic arithmetic operators
  - CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NOW() functions
  - AGE()
    ```sql
    SELECT AGE(timestamp '2005-09-11 00:00:00', timestamp '2005-09-09 12:00:00') 
    ```
  - EXTRACT(), DATE_PART(), DATE_TRUNC()

    
- Adding and subtracting integer values from date stamps
  - Will add and subtract from the days instead of the years or months in the yyyy-mm-dd format
  - Doing the same to a time stamp will get you an interval between the two dates
    - 2010-01-01 00:00:00 - 2010-01-01 12:00:00 will return 12 hrs
  ```sql
  SELECT rental_date + INTERVAL '3 days' as expected_return
  FROM rental;

  SELECT timestamp '2019-05-01' + 21 * INTERVAL '1 day'; 
  ```
- Functions for retreiving current date/time
  - Getting the current time stamp using the NOW() function
  ```sql
  SELECT NOW()
  SELECT NOW()::timestamp; 
  ```
  - Using the CAST() function to do the same
  ```sql
  SELECT CAST(NOW() AS timestamp);
  ```
  - CURRENT_TIMESTAMP achieves the same thing as NOW() function and can be used interchangably.
    - Can input a parameter in the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(x) where the second will be rounded to the x value
  - CURRENT_DATE gets you the current date without a time stamp
  - CURRENT_TIME gets you the current time without the date
- Extracting and transforming date / time data
  - EXTRACT(field FROM source)
  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(quarter FROM timestamp '2010-01-01 00:00:00') AS quarter
  ```
  - DATE_PART('field', source)
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_PART('quarter',timestamp '2010-01-01 00:00:00') AS quarter 
  ```
  - Examples
  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(quarter FROM payment_date) AS quarter, 
    EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) AS year,
    SUM(amount) AS total_payment
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY 1,2; 
  ```
  - Truncating timestamps to transform timestamp to specified precision level
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', TIMESTAMP '2010-01-01 00:00:00');
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', TIMESTAMP '2010-01-01 00:00:00');
  ```
