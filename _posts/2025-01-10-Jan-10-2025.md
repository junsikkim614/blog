PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions
1. Introduction to window functions
   - Similar to GROUP BY functions, but all row remain in the output
     ```sql
      FUNCTION_NAME() OVER(...)
         # Subclauses for OVER() 
         ORDER BY
         PARTITION BY
         ROWS/RANGE PRECEDING/FOLLOWING/UNBOUNDED
     ```
    - ORDER BY()
      - ORDER BY inside the window function performed before ORDER BY outside of window function
    - LAG()
      - returns column's value at the row n rows before the current row 
    ```sql
    LAG(column, n) OVER(...)
    ```
      - Reigning Champ EX:
      ```sql
      # setting up CTE 
      WITH Discus_Gold AS(
        SELECT
          Year, Country AS Champion
        FROM Summer_Medals
        WHERE
          YEAR IN (1996,2000,2004,2008,2012)
          AND Gender = 'Men' AND Medal = 'Gold'
          AND Event = 'Discus Throw')

      # Using LAG() 
      SELECT
        Year, Champion,
        Lag(Champion, 1) OVER(ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
      FROM Discus_Gold
      ORDER BY Year ASC
    ```

      - Atheletes Medal Count EX:
         - Creates CTE that counts all the medals athletes have earned
         - Then uses that CTE to rank who won the most medals and numbers the rows
   
      ```sql
      # Setting up CTE
      WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
      SELECT
        -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
        Athlete,
        COUNT(*) AS Medals
      FROM Summer_Medals
      GROUP BY Athlete)
    
      SELECT
        -- Number each athlete by how many medals they've earned
        athlete,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Athlete_Medals.Medals DESC) AS Row_N
      FROM Athlete_Medals
      ORDER BY Medals DESC;
      ```

    - PARTITION BY for multiple columns EX :
      ```sql
      WITH Country_Gold AS (
        SELECT
          DISTINCT Year, Country, Event
        FROM Summer_Medals
        WHERE
          Year IN (2008,2012)
          AND Country IN ('CHN', 'JPN)
          AND Gender = 'Women' AND Medal = 'Gold')

      SELECT
        Year, Country, Event,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Year, Country)
      FROM Country_Gold; 
      ```
        - Selects gold medalist women in China and Japan and creates CTE
        - Assigns new row number by the year and country as it is partitioned by those two columns
2. Fetching, ranking, and paging
   - Four functions
       - LAG(column, n) - fetches column's value at the row n rows before the current row
       - LEAD(column, n) - fetches column's value at the row n rows after the current row
           ```sql
            WITH Hosts AS(
             SELECT DISTINCT Year, City
             FROM Summer_Medals)

           SELECT Year, City
             LEAD(City,1) OVER(ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Next_City
             LEAD(City,2) OVER(ORDER BY Year ASC) AS After_Next_City
           FROM Hosts
           ORDER BY Year ASC; 
           ```
       - FIRST_VALUE(column) - fetches the first value in the table or partition
       - LAST_VALUE(column) - fetches the last value in the table or partition
           ```sql
            SELECT
               Year, CIty,
               FIRST_VALUE(City) OVER(ORDER BY Year ASC) AS First_City,
               LAST_VALUE(City) OVER(ORDER BY Year ASC RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS Last_City
             FROM Hosts
             ORDER BY Year ASC;
           # RANGE BETWEEN ... Clause extends the window to the end of the table or partition 
           ```
   -  RANKING Function
       - ROW_NUMBER() : always assigns unique numbers, even if the rows' values are the same
       - RANK() assigns the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the next numbers in such case
       - DENSE_RANK() : assigns the same number to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over number
       - Ranking with partitioning EX:
         ```sql
         SELECT
           Country, Athlete,
           DENSE_RANK()
           OVER (PARTITION BY Country
                   ORDER BY Medas DESC) AS Rank_N
         FROM Country_Medals
         ORDER BY Country ASC, Medals DESC; 
         ```
           - Ranks each athelete by how many medals they won while partitioning for country so that they 
aren't compared with # of medals won by everyone but rather only within their own country.
    - PAGING
        - Paging: Splitting data into approx equal chunks
            - Uses: Many APIs return data in "pages" to reduce data being sent, Separating data into quartiles
thirds (top middle 33% and the bottome thirds) to judge performance
        - NTILE(n) splits the data into n approximately equal pages
        - NTILE() EX:
            ```sql
            WITH Country_Medals AS(
              SELECT
                Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
              FROM Summer_Medals
              GROUP BY Country),

            SELECT
              Country, Medals,
              NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Third
            FROM Country_Medals; 
            ```
            - Divides the countries into three chuncks ordered by the number of medals each country has won
