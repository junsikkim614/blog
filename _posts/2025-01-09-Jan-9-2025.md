Journal Entry 3

1. Window function
   - OVER()
       - EX
         ```sql
          SELECT
             date,
             (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals
             AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
         FROM match
         WHERE season = '2011/2012';
         ```
       - Allows aggregate functions to pass down into a data set
           - If not for OVER() the code above would result in an error as it doesn't have a GROUP BY after using 
              an aggregate function.

   - RANK()
     - EX
         ```sql
          SELECT
             date,
             (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
             RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal + away_goal DESC) AS goals_rank
         FROM match
         WHERE season = '2011/2012';
         ```
     - Orders by the aggregate function that is passed in OVER() for easier interpretation
     - It will include filters in the WHERE clause unlike a subquery
2. PARTITION BY
      - Calculate separate values for different categories
      - Calculate different calculations in the same column
      - EX
        ```sql
          SELECT
              date,
              (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
              AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_avg
          FROM match;
        ```
      - Partitioning over multiple column EX 
        ```sql
          SELECT
              date,
              (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
              AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY m.season, c.name) AS season_avg
          FROM match;
        ```
3. Sliding windows
      - Perform calculations relative to the current row
      - Used to calculate running totals, sums, averages, etc
      - Can be partitioned by one or more columns
        ```sql
        ROWS BETWEEN <start> AND <finish> 
        ```
        ```sql
        PRECEDING
        FOLLOWING
        UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
        UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
        CURRENT ROW
        ```
        - EX
        ```sql
        SELECT
          date,
          home_goal,
          away_goal,
          SUM(home_goal)
            OVER(ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN
              UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
        FROM match
        WHERE hometeam_id = 8456 AND season = '2011/2012';
        ```
