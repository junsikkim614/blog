Journal Entry 6

Pivoting, Rollup, Cube 

Pivot
- Transforms table from vertical to horizontal
- Easier to scan, especially if it is sequentially tabulated
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

  SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
    source_sql TEXT
  $$) AS ct (column1 DATA_TYPE_1,
             column2 DATA_TYPE_2,
             ...,
             columnn DATA_TYPE_n);
  ```
  ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

    SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
      SELECT
        Country, Year, COUNT(*) :: INTEGER AS Awards
      FROM Summer_Medals
      WHERE
        Country IN ('CHN','RUS','USA')
        AND Year IN (2008,2012)
        AND Medal = 'Gold'
      GROUP BY Country, Year
      ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
    $$) AS ct (Country VARCHAR, "2008" INTEGER, "2012" INTEGER)

    ORDER BY Country ASC; 
  ```
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

  SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
    WITH Country_Awards AS (
      SELECT
        Country,
        Year,
        COUNT(*) AS Awards
      FROM Summer_Medals
      WHERE
        Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
        AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
        AND Medal = 'Gold'
      GROUP BY Country, Year)
  
    SELECT
      Country,
      Year,
      RANK() OVER
        (PARTITION BY Year
         ORDER BY Awards DESC) :: INTEGER AS rank
    FROM Country_Awards
    ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
  -- Fill in the correct column names for the pivoted table
  $$) AS ct (Country VARCHAR,
             "2004" INTEGER,
             "2008" INTEGER,
             "2012" INTEGER)
  
  Order by Country ASC;
  ```
- ROLLUP
  - Group-level totals
  ```sql
  SELECT
    Country, Medal, COUNT(*) AS Awards
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year = 2008 AND Country IN ('CHN','RUS')
  GROUP BY Country, ROLLUP(Medal)
  ORDER BY Country ASC, Medal ASC; 
  ```
    - ROLLUP is a GROUP BY subclause that includes extra rows for group level aggregations
    - GROUP BY Country, ROLLUP(Medal) includes alll counts of Country and Medal level totals, then only counts Country level totals and fill in Medal
      with nulls for these rows
    - ROLLUP is hierarchical, de-aggregating from the left to the right
        - ROLLUP(Country, Medal) includes Country level totals while ROLLUP(Medal, Country) includes Medal level totals
        - Both will show the grand totals
    - Any row where it shows null is the total for that column
    - Rows with both nulls is showing the grand total 
     
 - CUBE
    - A non-hierarchical ROLLUP
    - Generates all possible group level aggregations
    - CUBE(Country, Medal) counts both country level and medal level totals as well as the grand total
 - When to use ROLLUP vs CUBE
   - ROLLUP when you have hierarchical data and don't want all possible group level aggregations
   - CUBE when you want all possible group level aggregations
 ```sql
-- Count the medals per gender and medal type
SELECT
  Gender,
  Medal,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2012
  AND Country = 'RUS'
-- Get all possible group-level subtotals
GROUP BY CUBE(Gender, Medal)
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Medal ASC;
 ```
- COALESCE
  - COALESCE() takes a list of values and returns the first non-null value, going from left to right
  - Can be used to get rid of the null values in ROLLUP and CUBE as well as pivoting
  ```sql
  SELECT
    COALESCE(Country, 'BOTH countries') AS Country,
    COALESCE(Medal, 'ALL medals') AS Medal,
    COUNT(*) AS Awards
  FROM summer_medals
  WHERE
    Year = 2008 AND Country in ('CHN','RUS')
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Medal)
  ORDER BY Country ASC, Medal ASC; 
  ```
    - Replaces all the null values in Medal column as ALL medals since the null values are showing the total for each country
    - Replaces all the null value in country as Both countries since the null value indicates the grand total for medals won by both countries
 - STRING_AGG
   - STRING_AGG(column, separator) takes all the values of a column and concatenates them, with separator in between each value
   - Useful when you have already sorted a column in a particular order making the other column redundant. EX: rank for each country (rank becomes redundant)
   ```sql
    WITH Country_Medals AS (...),
    Country_Ranks AS(...)
    SELECT STRING_AGG(Country,',')
    FROM Country_Medals;
   
   ```
